# SwiftUI & SwiftData: Comprehensive CRUD Operations Demo

This repository hosts a comprehensive demo project that illustrates the use of SwiftUI alongside SwiftData for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The project is aimed at developers looking to understand how to integrate SwiftUI views with a persistent data layer, apply basic design patterns for cleaner code, and maintain high code quality throughout the development process.

## Features

- **SwiftUI Interface**: Utilizes SwiftUI for the user interface, showcasing how to build responsive and adaptive UI components.
- **SwiftData Integration**: Demonstrates how to integrate SwiftData for data persistence, focusing on a seamless experience between the UI layer and the database.
- **CRUD Operations**: Includes examples of creating, reading, updating, and deleting data using SwiftData, all through a SwiftUI interface.
- **Basic Design Patterns**: Implements basic design patterns to organize code, enhance reusability, and simplify maintenance.
- **Code Quality**: Adheres to Swift best practices to ensure high code quality, including the use of SwiftLint for linting and code style enforcement.

To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine:

'git clone https://github.com/yourusername/swiftui-swiftdata-demo.git'


Navigate into the project directory and open the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode:

Run the project in Xcode to see the demo in action. Explore the code to understand how SwiftUI views interact with the SwiftData layer for CRUD operations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories: (WIP)

- `Models`: Contains the data models used throughout the project, integrated with SwiftData for persistence.
- `Views`: Houses the SwiftUI views and components, showcasing various UI elements and interactions.
- `ViewModels`: Includes the ViewModels that bridge the data layer with the UI, facilitating CRUD operations.

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance the demo, whether through additional features, bug fixes, or documentation improvements, are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
